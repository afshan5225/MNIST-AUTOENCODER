# MNIST Autoencoder

This project implements an autoencoder using the MNIST dataset, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras. The autoencoder learns to compress and then reconstruct handwritten digits, providing insights into the representation of data in a lower-dimensional space.

## Introduction

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder that compresses the input into a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the output from this representation. This project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits, to train the autoencoder.

## Libraries

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the data and results.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
